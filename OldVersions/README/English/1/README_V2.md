## What is a personal computer?

A personal computer is a _personal_ computer. This means that its owner should have full control of its functionality and files. This also means that proprietary software (also known as closed source software, freeware, trialware, shareware, etc.) should not be present, unless used within a virtual machine.

### History of the term

> **Note** _I am skipping lots of details to make this shorter. If you want a long, detailed history, see_ [`Wikipedia: Personal Computer`](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Personal_computer&oldid=1152473876&useskin=monobook)

In the early days of computing, mainframe computers were the dominant form of computers. These later evolved to minicomputers, starting in 1959, with advances in technology allowed the creation of more portable computers. It wasn't until the early 1970s when microcomputers became possible.

#### IBM PC compatibles

In the early 1970s, attempts were made towards consumer-oriented microcomputers. The early days of personal computers was mostly comprised of IBM PC compatibles, althouugh early Apple computers, and many other companies producing microcomputers were also available.

In the 1990s, IBM PCs exploded in popularity with Windows 3.0, 3.1, 95, and so on. A partnership between Microsoft and Intel (known as Wintel) became popular, and the PC became mainstream. Around this time (in 1991) the first version of the Linux kernel was first created.

#### Modern day

The term nowadays is mostly associated with Windows, and not Linux, MacOS, and other operating systems. This needs to change, as this does not fit the true definition of a personal computer.

The Raspberry Pi is a type of personal computer. It is a low budget computer that is good for basic tasks and programming, but it can also be used for lots of other things around the house.
